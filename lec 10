Problem Statement




Vijay wants to write a program for the multiplication of square matrices. Help him write the code.




Note: Square matrices mean the number of rows equals the number of columns in the given matrix.

Input format :

The first line of input consists of the matrix size M.

The next M lines of input consist of the M elements in each line separated by space representing the first matrix.

After being separated by a new line, the next M lines of input consist of the M elements in each line separated by space representing the first matrix.

Output format :

The output consists of the product of two matrices.




Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :

0 < M <= 10

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
2 3 2
3 2 3
3 3 3

4 5 6
2 3 1
1 2 3
Output 1 :
The product of the two matrices is:
16	23	21	
19	27	29	
21	30	30	

Input 2 :
2
2 2
2 3

5 6
7 8
Output 2 :
The product of the two matrices is:
24	28	
31	36	

Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.

To perform matrix multiplication in C++, you can use a nested loop structure. Here's the code to multiply two square matrices:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int M;
    cin >> M;

    // Input for the first matrix
    vector<vector<int>> matrix1(M, vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            cin >> matrix1[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Input for the second matrix
    vector<vector<int>> matrix2(M, vector<int>(M));
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            cin >> matrix2[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Initialize the result matrix with zeros
    vector<vector<int>> result(M, vector<int>(M, 0));

    // Perform matrix multiplication
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < M; ++k) {
                result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // Output the result matrix
    cout << "The product of the two matrices is:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
            cout << result[i][j] << "\t";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

You can use this code to input two square matrices and calculate their product.

Problem Statement




Ambika is designing a student information system for a school. Each student record consists of the student's name and age. Implement a program that allows Ambika to update the student's age using a pointer to a data member.




Class Name: Student




Note: This is a sample question asked in a Deloitte interview.

Input format :

The first line of input consists of the name of the student.

The second line of input consists of the age of the student.

The third line of input consists of the age to be updated.

Output format :

The first line of output displays the current or input age of the student.

The second line of output displays the updated age of the student.




Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :

3 <= length of the name <= 40

17 <= age <= 26

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
sandeep
20
23
Output 1 :
Current age: 20
Updated age: 23
Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
